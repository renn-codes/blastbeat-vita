## About
**BlastBEATT Raiders** is a dungeon crawler RPG for homebrew-enabled **Playstation Vita** consoles. It features design elements based off of the Game Boy Advance-era [Sting Entertainment (株式会社スティング)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sting_Entertainment) titles, primarily [Rivera: The Promised Land](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riviera:_The_Promised_Land).

The project is intended to be a personal love letter to the studio's NTSC-localized games, and an excuse to *~~torture myself with~~* finally learn C++.

## Story Synopsis (tbd)
The game is set in a post-apocalyptic world where the player must navigate through a series of dungeons to uncover the truth behind the world's destruction. The game features a unique combat system, a deep story, and retro-inspired graphics.

## Progress
So far I've got just a demo of the intro splash screens and main menu. The game is still in its early stages, but I'm working on it whenever I can.
